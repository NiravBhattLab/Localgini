1) SelfConsistency_analysis_cancer.m: To do the self consistency analysis on top of the CSMs to get the fractional contribution of reactions added by the MeMs in cancer cell lines data. Further to perform hypothesis test to get the pvalue on how different the distribution of fractional contribution of localgini derived models compared to the others
    - The results generated by this code is stored in the folder CancerCellLines
2) SelfConsistency_analysis_HPA.m: To do the self consistency analysis on top of the CSMs to get the fractional contribution of reactions added by the MeMs in the HPA data. Further to perform hypothesis test to get the pvalue on how different the distribution of fractional contribution of localgini derived models compared to the others
    - The results generated by this code is stored in the folder HPA
