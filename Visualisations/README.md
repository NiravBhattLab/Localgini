1) HK_rxns_core.ipynb: To generate the violin plot required to compare the number of housekeeping reactions rectified by each of the thresholding methods (Figure 2B in main text)
2) HK_count_data.ipynb: To generate the bar plot that shows count of contexts that captures the corresponding HK reactions (Supplementary Figures S2,S3,S4)
3) HK_reactions_rec_model.ipynb: To generate the violin plot required to compare the number of housekeeping reactions rectified by each of the context specific models built from distinct thresholding methods (Figure S5 in Supplementary text)
4) hall_mark.ipynb: To generate the violin plot to compare number of cancer hall mark genes rectified by the context-specific models built from distict thresholding methods (Figure S6 in Supplementary text).
