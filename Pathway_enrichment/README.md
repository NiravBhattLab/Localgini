# Details of the code files in the folder

1) enrichment_analysis_r3.m: To do enrichment analysis on the core reactions derived from Recon2.2 model to identify the enriched pathways
    - The results generated are stored in the file enrichment_mats_recon22.mat. This file is further used to generate the Figure S6
2) enrichment_analysis_r3d.m: To do enrichment analysis on the core reactions derived from Recon3D model to identify the enriched pathways
    - The results generated are stored in the file enrichment_mats_recon3d.mat. This file is further used to generate the Figure S8
3) enrichment_analysis_ih.m: To do enrichment analysis on the core reactions derived from Human1 model to identify the enriched pathways
    - The results generated are stored in the file enrichment_mats_ihuman.mat. This file is further used to generate the Figure S9
